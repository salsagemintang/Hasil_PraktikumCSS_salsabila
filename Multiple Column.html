	  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
	  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
	  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
	  specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but aso the leap into 
	  electronic typesetting, remaining essentialy unchanged. It was popularised industry
	  the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
	  and more recently with dekstop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
	  content of a page when looking at its layout. The point oh using Lorem Ipsum is 
	  that is has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
	  'Content here, content here', making it look like redable English. Many dekstop
	  publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ispsum as their default mode
	  text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many wes sites still in their infancy.
	   Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
	   purpose (injected humour and the like).
